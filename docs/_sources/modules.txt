The *Apsis* pipeline produces science quality data from ACS image data
that have been pre-processed with the *CALACS* calibration pipeline from
STScI.  The main processing steps are registration of images to a common
coordinate system (taking in to account the strong geometric distortion
of the ACS detectors), removal of the sky background, combining of
images taken with the same filter with an iterative cosmic ray (CR)
rejection scheme, astrometric calibration, creation of noise (RMS)
images, combining the different filter images to create a higher signal
to noise ratio "detection image", cataloging sources in the detection image while
performing photometry of the filter images on all the found sources
using *SExtractor*, and correction of the photometry for Galactic dust
extinction and aperture size effects.
