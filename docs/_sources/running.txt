Running Apsis
=============

Quickstart
----------

*Apsis* is run from the command line as follows::

  apsis [options] <dataset>

Where ``[options]`` indicates one or more of the options listed below,
and ``<dataset>`` is the name of the dataset to be processed.  

*Apsis* looks for a directory named ``<dataset>`` off of the directory
referenced by the environment variable ``$INGEST``.  The directory
``<dataset>`` should contain the ACS images (i.e. ``*_flt.fits`` files)
and association tables (``*_asn.fits``) which reference these images and
nothing else (see the `Preliminary steps <prelims.html>`_ section for more details).

Note: ``<dataset>`` should not include a trailing slash, ``/``, or
*Apsis* will crash.

The products produced by *Apsis* as well as a log file and XML output
are written to a directory named ``<dataset>`` off of the directory
referenced by the environment variable ``$DATASETS``.

Output directory structure and files
------------------------------------

*Apsis* writes a series of output files to the ``<dataset>`` directory
it creates off of the directory set with the ``$DATASETS`` environment
variable.  

Main directory: <dataset>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. cmdoption:: <dataset>_proc.log 

   *Apsis* process log file.

.. cmdoption:: <dataset>_runMessage.xml

   This file lists, in XML format, the modules used, input data files
   and output data files, as well as meta data on when the process was
   run and by whom.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Catalogs directory: <dataset>/Catalogs
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This directory contains plain ASCII format catalogs made by *SExtractor*
catalogs modified by *Apsis*, and catalogs marked up in XML.  In general,
files ending with a suffix ``.cat.old`` are made directly by
*SExtractor*; files with a ``.cat`` suffix are modified SExtractor
catalogs; and files with a ``.xml`` suffix are XML marked-up version of
the .cat files.

.. cmdoption:: detectionImage.cat  (.xml)

   *SExtractor* catalog of the detection image, modified by *Apsis*.

.. cmdoption:: <dataset>_<filt>_drz_sci.cat   (.xml, .old.cat)

   Catalog of each filter image created by running *SExtractor* in dual
   image mode with detections from the detection image and photometry
   from the filter image.  Here ``<filt>`` is the filter name in lower
   case.  The ``.old.cat`` version of the file is the *SExtractor*
   catalog before being modified by *Apsis*.

.. cmdoption:: multicolor.cat

   ASCII file listing the final integrated photometry (magnitude and
   error) of each object in each filter, corrected for extinction and
   aperture size.

.. cmdoption:: multicolor.columns

   Description of the columns in ``multicolor.cat``.

.. <full-filter-name>_photometry.xml

   The "_BPZ" photometry that is listed in the ``multicolor.cat`` file
   is here marked up in XML.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Images directory: <dataset>/Images
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This directory holds the simple FITS format image output from *Apsis*
(``.fits`` suffix), files holding XML marked up versions of
their headers (``_fits.xml`` suffix) and a variety of associated files.

In the following ``<dataset>`` is the dataset name, ``<filt>`` is the
filter name in lowercase, ``<FILT>`` is the filter name in uppercase,
``<infile>`` is the base name of an input file excluding the ``.fits``
suffix (e.g. for an input image ``j90v01ayq_flt.fits`` then ``<infile> =
j90v01ayq_flt``).

*Detection image and related products*

.. cmdoption:: detectionImage.fits (_fits.xml)

   The output detection image made by summing the filter images and
   weighting by the inverse variance.

.. cmdoption:: detectionWeight.fits (_fits.xml) 

   The weight image corresponding to the detection Image.  This is a
   MAP_WEIGHT type weight image in *SExtractor* parlance.

.. cmdoption:: detectionImage_APER.fits (_fits.xml)

   Output aperture image from *SExtractor*.

.. cmdoption:: detectionImage_SEGM.fits (_fits.xml)

   *SExtractor* segmentation image - the pixel value gives the object identification
   in the output catalog ``detectionImage.cat`` (see `Catalogs directory: <dataset>/Catalogs`_). 

.. cmdoption:: Edgemask.fits

   I am not sure what this file is for\?\?\?\? 

*Filter images and related products*

.. cmdoption:: <dataset>_<filt>_drz_sci.fits (_fits.xml)

   The filter images, one for each filter used in the dataset.  Pixel
   values are given as electrons (actually it is the count rate in
   electron/s multiplied by the EXPTIME in the header).

.. cmdoption:: <dataset>_<filt>_drz_sci_weight.fits (_fits.xml)

   The weight image corresponding to each filter image.  This is a
   MAP_WEIGHT type weight image in *SExtractor* parlance.

.. cmdoption:: <dataset>_<filt>_drz_sci_context.fits (_fits.xml)

   The "context" image produced for each filter image during the drizzle
   process.  This is a bitmask image where the pixel value encodes which
   input images were used to create that pixel. More information on
   context images can be found in the 
   `drizzle documentation <http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/gethelp.cgi?drizzle>`_.

.. cmdoption:: <dataset>_<filt>_drz_sci_BACK.fits (_fits.xml)

   Background image for each filter, created by *SExtractor* during the
   cataloging stage.

.. cmdoption:: <dataset>_<filt>_RMS.fits (_fits.xml)

   The error in the pixel values of each filter image.

.. cmdoption:: <dataset>_<filt>_FLAG.fits (_fits.xml)

   Binary bad pixel mask that marks each pixel of the filter images as either
   bad (1) or good (0).

.. cmdoption:: medriz_<n>.fits

   The median combined version of each filter image, used in the cosmic
   ray rejection process.  Here ``<n>`` refers to the order in which the
   filters are processed.  The correspondence with the filters used can
   be determined by looking at the image headers.

.. cmdoption:: <dataset>_<FILT>_asn.fits

   This is a copy of the association table used to make each filter
   image. 

.. cmdoption:: <dataset>_<filt>_augmask.fits (_fits.xml)

   I am not sure what these files are.\?\?\?\?

*Products of each input image*

Here ``<n>`` is 1 or 2 and refers to the science extension in the
original multiextension fits image.  For WFC images ``<n>`` = 1 or 2; for
HRC (and SBC) images ``<n>`` = 1 (always).

.. cmdoption:: <infile>_SCI_<n>.fits

   Science extension ``<n>`` of ``<infile>.fits`` broken out into a simple fits image.

.. cmdoption:: <infile>_SCI_<n>_cr.fits

   Binary good pixel mask indicating cosmic rays found in the individual
   frames found when creating the filter images.  These files mark
   cosmic rays 0 and good pixels 1.

*Temporary files*

These are deleted unless the option ``--noclean`` is used. Here
``<n>`` is 1 or 2 and refers to the science extension in the original
multiextension fits image.

.. cmdoption:: _cx_<infile>_SCI_<n>.fits

   The context image for each input image.  This is a binary good pixel
   bitmask that marks pixels in the output frame where the corresponding
   simple fits image ``<infile>_SCI_<n>.fits`` contributes with 1, with
   the remaining unused pixels marked 0.

.. cmdoption:: _wt_<infile>_SCI_<n>.fits

   The weight image for each input image. This indicates the
   contribution to the output weight from the corresponding simple fits
   image ``<infile>_SCI_<n>.fits``.

.. cmdoption:: Orig_<infile>_inmask<n>.fits

   Original binary good pixel bitmask in the pixel grid of the
   corresponding simple fits image ``<infile>_SCI_<n>.fits``. Note that
   not all the pixels marked bad here (pixel value = 0) are considered
   bad when creating the corresponding ``_cx_<infile>_SCI_<n>.fits``.

.. cmdoption:: <infile>_inmask<n>.fits

   Binary good pixel bitmask in the pixel grid of the
   corresponding simple fits image ``<infile>_SCI_<n>.fits``. \?\?\?\? It is
   not clear to me what the difference between the different inamsk
   files are ... \?\?\?\?

.. cmdoption:: <infile>_SCI_<n>_bl.fits

   The median drizzled filter image "blotted" back to the pixel grid of
   the corresponding input simple fits image ``<infile>_SCI_<n>.fits``.

.. cmdoption:: <infile>_SCI_<n>_bl_deriv.fits

   Estimate of the local image "derivative", derived from the median
   drizzled filter image, in the pixel grid of
   the corresponding input simple fits image ``<infile>_SCI_<n>.fits``.

These include ``A``, ``B``, (and other single capital letter variants),
``medianfilter_input`` and ``medianimages``.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Messages directory: <dataset>/Messages
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The files in this directory are named ``<modnam>_module.xml``, where
''<modnam>'' is the name of the *Apsis* modules that were run on this
dataset.  Each XML file documents 

  * the module name, version, and dataset name.

  * the dependencies (packages) used, their version, and command line
    call.

This directory contains python objects that are converted to a string
representation called a "pickle" and saved to a file.  Since pickles are
storred in jars these files are referred to as pickle jars.  There is
one pickle jar describing the dataset, named ``obs``, with the remaining
files corresponding to each module that was run.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
align directory: <dataset>/align
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This directory contains files used in the image alignment process.

   Output from supermatch.  This gives the final x, y, and rotation shifts.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
astrom directory: <dataset>/astrom
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This directory contains files used in aligning the images to the guide
star catalog reference frame.  These include results from a web query to
the GSC, *SExtractor* generated catalogs of the filter images, products
derived from these catalogs, and results of matching the GSC to the
filter images.  

Detailed description TBD.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
par directory: <dataset>/par
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This directory contains the *SExtractor* configuration files for the
various *SExtractor* runs done by *Apsis*.  The ``*.inpar`` files set
the parameters used by *SExtractor* while the ``*.param`` files dictate
which *SExtractor* measurements will be written to the output catalogs.
 
Detailed description TBD.
