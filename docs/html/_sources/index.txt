Apsis - the ACS data reduction pipeline
=======================================

*Apsis* is the image processing and analysis pipeline for data from the
Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS).  It
can work with images from any of ACS's three cameras: the Wide Field
Channel (WFC), the High Resolution Channel (HRC), and the Solar Blind
Channel (SBC).  It processes the images by aligning them, co-adding
images observed with the same filter, making a detection image from the
individual filter images, cataloging the sources found in the detection
image, measures photometry for these sources in all filters and correcting
the results for aperture effects and foreground extinction.  *Apsis* is
written mostly in python with some code in C.  *Apsis* was developed for
the ACS GTO team and should not be confused with CALACS.
