Apsis - the ACS data reduction pipeline
=======================================

*Apsis* is the image processing and analysis pipeline for data from the
Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS).  It
can work with images from any of ACS's three cameras: the Wide Field
Channel (WFC), the High Resolution Channel (HRC), and the Solar Blind
Channel (SBC).  

*Apsis* processing includes aligning images, co-adding the images
observed with the same filter, making a detection image from the
individual filter images, cataloging the sources found in the detection
image, measuring photometry for these sources in all filters and
correcting the results for aperture effects and foreground extinction.
*Apsis* is written mostly in python with some code in C.  *Apsis* was
developed for the ACS GTO team and should not be confused with `CALACS
<http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/gethelp.cgi?calacs>`_ the `STScI
<http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/>`_ pipeline to
preform basic calibrations of ACS data.
