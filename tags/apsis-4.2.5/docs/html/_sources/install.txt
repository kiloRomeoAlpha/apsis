*Apsis* and its reference files can be obtained from `Google Codes
<http://code.google.com/p/apsis>`_ .

Dependent Software
------------------

In addition to the *Apsis* source code, the following packages are
needed for *Apsis* to run.  Packages indicated with \* are included with
the `Scisoft suite <http://web.mac.com/npirzkal/Scisoft/Scisoft.html>`_
of astronomical software for Mac OS X.  Version 2009.6.1 for intel based
macs, `available here <http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/20126>`_, is known to
the relevant software that works with apsis.  The precise versions
listed below have been tested and work with apsis.  Earlier or later
versions may also work, but we can not guarantee that.  Here we note
some versions of the software that do not work with apsis.

* `python 2.5.4 <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5.4/>`_ \*

  + **warning:** *Apsis* will not work with *python 2.6* or higher

* python modules: 

  + `numpy 1.3.0 <http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/>`_ \*
  + `pyfits 2.1.1 <http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits/Download>`_ \*

* `stsci_python 2.8 <http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyraf/stsci_python/current/download>`_ \*

  + includes *pyraf* 1.7.1 
  + includes `pydrizzle 6.3.1 <http://stsdas.stsci.edu/stsci_python_epydoc/docs/pydrizzle/pydrizzle-module.html>`_

* `iraf 2.14.1 <http://iraf.noao.edu/>`_ \*

  + should include `tables/stsdas 3.10 <http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/stsdas/download>`_ \*

* `sextractor 2.5.0 <http://astromatic.iap.fr/software/sextractor/>`_ \*
* `match 0.10 <http://spiff.rit.edu/match/>`_ \*
* `dust_getval v2000.07.14, version (C+Fortran code) <http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~schlegel/dust/data/data.html>`_

Installation on a Mac OSX system
--------------------------------

This is realtively easy because most of the required software is
bundled with *Scisoft*, which includes executables.  So installation
amounts to mainly a matter of installing *Apsis* and *Scisoft*.  Only
one additional package is needed, *dust_getval*; it with its reference
data must be downloaded and the package compiled.  The following is the
procedure that worked on my intel MacBook (Aug 2009); variations on this
may also work.

1. Download and install `Scisoft suite 
   <http://web.mac.com/npirzkal/Scisoft/Scisoft.html>`_ . 

   * click download link at *Scisoft* webpage
   * click link for intel version
   * click "Download Scisoft now" link. 
   * Download the file Scisoft_OSX_macintel_2009.6.1.pkg.zip
   * double click this file in finder.  This will open the zip file with
     *Stuffit*.
   * double click the pkg file
   * follow the instructions to install
     
     + This should put the software in /Applications/scisoft

   * To run scisoft packages you will need to do 

     + "source /Applications/scisoft/all/bin/setup.csh"
     + I placed this command at the end of my ~/.cshrc file so it is run
       whenever I startup

2. Download *Apsis* and the *Apsis* reference files and install them.

   * Make a directory for *Apsis*.  I used ~/ACS/Apsis
   * Go to the `Google Codes <http://code.google.com/p/apsis>`_  web
     site.
   * click on the link "apsis-4.2.2.tgz" to download the source code (to the relevant
     directory, i.e. ~/ACS/Apsis)
   * unpack using "tar tvzf apsis-4.2.2.tgz"

     + this makes a directory apsis-4.2.2 containing the software

   * click on the link "apsis-4.2_reffiles.tgz" to download the
     reference files (to the relevant directory, i.e. ~/ACS/Apsis)

     + this makes a directory "reffiles" containing the reference files

3. compile apsis utilities

   * cd ~/ACS/Apsis/apsis-4.2.2/src/apsis_utils
   * edit Makefile to change CFITSIO path (if necessary)
   * make
   * make install
     (NOTE: the binaries are installed in ~/apsis/bin)

4. make symbolic link for *match*.  (*Apsis* calls this program as
   "mrmatch"). 

   * cd ~/local/bin
   * ln -s /Applications/scisoft/i386/Packages/match-0.10/bin/match .
   * ln -s /Applications/scisoft/i386/Packages/match-0.10/bin/match mrmatch

5. download, compile and install *dust_getval*

   * go to http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~schlegel/dust/data/data.html
   * click on link "C+FORTRAN code" this will download CodeC.tar.gz
   * put this somewhere in your $PATH .  I put it in ~/local
   * cd ~/local
   * tar xvzf CodeC.tar.gz
   * cd CodeC
   * Edit Makefile so that it compiles - make sure the code block
     following "# COMPILE ON A DEC ALPHA" is uncommented since it uses
     gcc and g77, and similar blocks for other compilers are commented
     out.
   * make all
   * mkdir ~/local/dust_getval-20000714
   * mv dust_getval lambert_getval predict_sync predict_thermal
     ~/local/dustgetval-20000714
   * cd ~/local/bin
   * ln -s ./dust_getval-20000714/dust_getval .

6. Install dust maps

   * go to http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~schlegel/dust/data/data.html
   * click on link "4096 maps" .  This will download "SFD_4096.tar.gz"
   * unpack this into an apropriate directory:

     - cd ~/ACS/Apsis/reffiles/maps
     - tar xvzf ~/Downloads/SFD_4096.tar.gz 

Installation on a linux system
------------------------------

Detailed instructions are not yet written.  The basic process would be
to:

1. download the individual packages listed above
2. unpack them in to apropriate directories
3. make compiled and executable versions as necessary
4. make sure the executables are in your $PATH
