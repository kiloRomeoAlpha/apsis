Introduction
============

The ACS science team developed *Apsis* to efficiently process the ~550
orbits of GTO time we received in exchange for our instrument development and
calibration work.  *Apsis* (ACS pipeline science investigation software) is
designed to be a robust and flexible astronomical data reduction and analysis
pipeline for processing these data and related observations.  *Apsis* is
written in Python using a flexible, modular design.  *Apsis* was
used for processing the ACS early release observation (ERO) images of the
Tadpole and Mice galaxies, the Cone Nebula, and M17 soon after ACS was
installed on the Hubble Space Telescope, and for almost all team ACS
observations since then.  It has developed and been used extensively on
Linux, Solaris, and Mac OSX platforms for processing WFC and HRC data from
both science and calibration programs.

An early description of *Apsis* can be found in `Blakeslee et al. (2003).

What it does
************

A single *Apsis* run will process an "observation object" consisting of all
the images of a given field (or mosaic of overlapping fields).  The input
images to *Apsis* are the the FLT output images produced by the CALACS
software (Hack 1999) which is run on all HST/ACS products as part of the
STScI pipeline processing.  The FLT images are organized into "associations"
of all the images in one filter using FITS format association tables (one per
filter).  

The observation object is passed through a variety of modules which perform
the main processing steps:

    * Measurement of the offsets and rotation between frames corrected for
      distortion.
    * Sky estimation and subtraction.
    * Image stacking with cosmic ray (CR) rejection and "drizzling" of each
      association on to a tangential-plane pixel grid.
    * Construction of error arrays.
    * Construction of a multi-band "detection image".
    * Object detection and measurement.
    * Photometric calibration.
    * (Photo-z estimation is now deprecated)

A running log keeps track of progress and records diagnostics.  Other output
products consist of FITS images (including weights and masks), ASCII
catalogs, and XML marked messages, catalogs and FITS headers which are used
for in-house archiving purposes.
