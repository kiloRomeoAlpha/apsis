class drizzleImage:
    """Some notes on the combDither module and its implementation of xydrizzle.

    combDither currently contains one class, drizzleImage, which defines
    methods for drizzling dithered image associations to a final images,
    including cosmic ray rejection, etc.  The original intention was to
    create other classes with methods for combining the images using other
    routines (e.g., SWARP, or something based on python numerical arrays).

    The basic procedure for processing a dataset through drizzle:

    drob = drizzleImage(obs,al.MatchDict) - create instance of this class
    drob.run_all()          -   run the drizzle/blot/drizzle sequence
    drob.makeFlagImage()    -   create Sextractor flag image for each asn
    drob.makeRmsImage()     -   create Sextractor rms image for each asn
    drob.fixAstrometry(obs) -   fix the astrometry of the images if possible.

    [The fixAstrometry method must receive a DataSet object (obs) and will generally
    be called by the apsis pipeline.  This behaviour is not internally consistent
    but the method is a bit of hack to removed the need for the pipeline to
    deal with a new object (an instance of astrometer.gscMatchup) and all the
    attendant messaging for that.  N.B. This method should not be called internally.]

    Alternatively, the user can replace run_all() with run_drizzle() if no
    cosmic ray rejection is desired.  This module no longer makes its own
    association tables, but just uses the original ones that are given as
    inputs to the pipeline.

    The run_all method does three things:

    1. run_drizzle() drizzles images onto separate output images
    2. runs pyblot (median stacks, blots, derivs, cr_rej) which
        returns the list of cr masks for 2nd drizzling
    3. run_drizzle() to drizzles images all together using CR masks
        from pyblot

    run_drizzle() is the heart of the drizzleImage class.  It runs pydrizzle
    on all of the association tables in the asnTableList and takes a number
    of optional parameters (outshape=None, deltmp=1, units='counts',
    bits=_goodBits_, separDriz=0, crmasks=None, exptimePyDrKludge=0).
    Here's what the params are for

    outshape:  x,y sizes of output drizzled image (def: determined 'otf')
    deltmp:    delete temporary (masks, coeffs) files? (def: 1 [yes])
    units:     units of output pixel values (def: counts)
    bits:      sum of all possible good-pixel values in dq array
          ('None' means don't use masks).
          The default value bits=8450 is the sum of the pix values
          that we accept as being good, bits = 0+2+256+8192 = 8450,
          which includes 'good', 'replaced', 'saturated',and
          'CR-repaired', but NOTE THAT THESE VALUES ARE PARTICULAR 
          TO CALACS! [ISR ACS-99-03]

    The remainder of the params relate to pyblot setup and results:
    crmasks:            List of (mask,nzap) tuples from pyblot
    separDriz:          Drizzle onto separate output images?

    run_drizzle loops over all associations and runs pydrizzle on them.  
    It measures the shift 'zeropoint' based on the mean of all the measured
    shifts and then sets the relative shifts accordingly, ensuring that all
    associations will have the same absolute shift zeropoint, as well as the
    same image size.  This *seems* to be ok, although the output WCS may then
    disagree with pydrizzle's idea of the WCS of the output product, but drizzle
    itself constructs the WCS image in the output product from the input and
    whatever image headers it gets.

    For each association, run_drizzle creates the pydrizzle object, then
    goes through the parlist (list of dictionaries holding input drizzle
    parameters).  It modifies these parlists in various way, e.g., it makes
    the output images different if 'separDriz' has been set.  It also sets
    the x,y shifts and rotations to whatever is in the MatchDict (thus,
    making delta shifts in the asn tables no longer necessary).  The list of
    modified parlists is saved as a class attribute.  It then runs drizzle.

    After the 2nd drizzle (separdriz = 0), the code checks if:
    (1) the number of science extensions in the multi-extension FITS (mef)
    file is greater than 1 and units='counts' (the default); if so, it
    divides the count levels by the number of extensions.
    (2) if the pydrizzle version is less than 1.4; if so and Nsci>1, then it
    divides the output exposure times by the number of science extensions.

    If it's the final drizzle, then it also goes through all the input images
    and sums the alignSky values in the headers and writes the sum to the
    science image header.  That's it.  The makeFlagImage and makeRmsImage
    methods are pretty straightforward.

    The drizzle kernel, for the *final drizzle only* can now be set when
    run_drizzle or run_all is called. The drizzle-default linear ('square')
    kernel is the fastest, and tends to smooth over bad pixels better,
    but the psf is not as tight and the noise correlation is much worse.

    The damped sinc interpolant ('lanczos3') is sometimes called the
    optimal kernel, though beware that you may get holes (negative
    pixels) in the output.  These holes can happen anywhere, though more
    commonly near stars, etc.  Because of the masking of bad pixels and
    columns (based on the DQ array), occasionally a pixel in the output
    image will have very little data from the input image, and by a
    quirk of the interpolation kernel with its negative sidelobes, will
    end up with a negative value.  Richard Hook said to check the
    drizzle weight image to make sure that those negative pixels are
    given very little weight; if they have low weight, just don't use
    them, but if their weight is high, then there might be a problem.
    I checked several of these pixels, and found they were given low
    weight, about 1/10 of the median, so it seems ok.  Of course, if
    there are multiple dithered images, these negative pixels get filled
    in quickly by other pixels with much higher weight.  For the linear
    kernel you don't get this effect because there are no negative
    sidelobes.

    One caveat: run_drizzle overwrites shifts, rotations, and output product
    names in the pydrizzle parlist rather than setting them through methods.
    This was historically necessary for the shifts (and *still* the most
    straightforward way), and it's still necessary for drizzling onto
    separate outputs for blotting.  So, I wouldn't recommend changing it,
    but we have to be careful in case later pydrizzles change the parlist
    elements or their meanings.
